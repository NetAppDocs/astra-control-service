Astra Control attempts to automatically register your account for support when you set up your account. If it can't, then you can manually register for support yourself. Support registration is required to obtain help from NetApp technical support.

== Verify your support registration

Astra Control includes a Support Status field that enables you to confirm your support registration.

.Steps

. Click *Support*.

. Take a look at the Support Status field.
+
The Support Status starts off as "Not Registered" but then moves to "In-Progress" and finally to "Registered" once complete.
+
This support registration status is polled every 15 minutes. New NetApp customers could take up to next business day to complete onboarding and support registration. If the serial number doesn't show "Registered" within 48 hours, you can reach out to NetApp using astra.feedback@netapp.com or register manually from https://register.netapp.com.

== Obtain your serial number

When you register for an account, Astra Control uses the information that you provided about your company to generate a 20-digit NetApp serial number that starts with "941."

The NetApp serial number represents your Astra Control account. You'll need to use this serial number when opening a web ticket.

You can find your serial number in the Astra Control interface from the *Support* page.
