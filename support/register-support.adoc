Project Astra attempts to automatically register your account for support when you set up your account. If it can't, then you can manually register for support yourself. Support registration is required to obtain help from NetApp technical support.

== Verify your support registration

Project Astra includes a Support Status field that enables you to confirm your support registration.

.Steps

. Click *Support*.

. Take a look at the Support Status field.
+
The Support Status starts off as "Not Registered" but then moves to "In-Progress" and finally to "Registered" once complete.
+
You can refresh your screen to get a current snapshot of process.
+
If you have any issues registering your serial number, contact us at projectastra.feedback@netapp.com.

== Obtain your serial number

When you accept your Beta invitation, Project Astra prompts you to set up your account. Project Astra uses the information that you provide about your company to generate a 20-digit NetApp serial number that starts with "941".

The NetApp serial number represents your Project Astra account. You'll need to use this serial number when opening a web ticket.

You can find your serial number in the Project Astra interface from the *Support* page.
