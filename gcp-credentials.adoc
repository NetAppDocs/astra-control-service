= Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Credentials
:imagesdir: assets/gcp-credentials/

To create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cluster you will need to either create a new GCP project and credentials, or get the Service Account JSON data from your existing GCP project.

To use this feature, you will need an NKS account. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.

After you have added your GCP credentials to your NKS account, https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/kubernetes-service/create-gce-cluster.html[click here to learn how to create a Kubernetes cluster on GCE]

== Create a New Set of GCP Credentials

To create a new set of GCP credentials you will need to:

1. Create a new project.
2. Enable the Google Compute Engine API.
3. Create the credentials.

=== Create a New Project

NKS must be set up to manage a project within your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account. To do this, log into the Google cloud console at https://console.cloud.google.com.

Click **Project** to open the drop-down menu.

In the pop-up window which appears, select an organization from the drop-down menu.

Click the **+** to Create Project.

Fill in "NKS" as the project name, then click **Create**.

It may take a few moments for the project to be created. Once the task is complete, you will be redirected to the project Dashboard.

=== Enable the Google Compute Engine API

The next step is to use the API Manager to enable the Google Compute Engine API for this project. Click **APIs & Services > Dashboard** in the navigation column on the left.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gce/click-api-manager.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: API Manager]

This will take you to the API Manager Dashboard. Click **ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES**.

This will take you to the API Library. Click **Compute Engine API**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gce/compute-engine-api.png?raw=true[Google Compute Engine: Click Compute Engine API]

This will take you to the Compute Engine API page. Click **ENABLE** to enable the API.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gce/click-enable-api.png?raw=true[Google Compute Engine: Click ENABLE]

=== Create Credentials

After the new project has been created, click the **Credentials** link on the left to create credentials.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gce/click-credentials.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: Click Credentials]

In the pop-up window which appears, click **Create credentials**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gce/create-credentials.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: Create Credentials]

From the drop-down menu, choose **Service account key**.

Click the **Service account** drop-down menu and choose **New service account**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gce/service-account-drop-down.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: Service account key]

Fill out the following:

* In the **Service Account Name** field, give your account a name like `nks-admin`.
* For **Role** select **Project** > **Owner**.
* For **Key type** select **JSON**.

Then click **Create**.

The JSON credentials (keyset) will automatically be saved to your local computer.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-gce/credentials-saved.png?raw=true[Google Container Engine: Credentials saved]

Locate the new `.json` file in your downloads folder and open it with a plaintext editor such as Notepad. Copy and paste the contents into https://nks.netapp.io[the NKS website] when you create a new cluster.

== Find Your Existing GCE Credentials

You can only view or download the Service Account JSON file when you create the key. However, you can create a new key at any time.

=== Create a New GCE Service Account Key

Log in to the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google cloud console]. Click **IAM & Admin**.
