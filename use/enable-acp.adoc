Astra Trident versions 23.10 and later include the option to use Astra Control Provisioner, which enables licensed Astra Control users to access advanced storage provisioning functionality. Astra Control Provisioner provides this extended functionality in addition to standard Astra Trident CSI-based functionality. You can use this procedure to enable and install Astra Control Provisioner.

Your Astra Control Service subscription automatically includes the license for Astra Control Provisioner use.

In coming Astra Control updates, Astra Control Provisioner will replace Astra Trident as storage provisioner and orchestrator and be mandatory for Astra Control use. Because of this, it's strongly recommended that Astra Control users enable Astra Control Provisioner. Astra Trident will continue to remain open source and be released, maintained, supported, and updated with new CSI and other features from NetApp.

.How do I know if I need to enable Astra Control Provisioner?

If you add a cluster to Astra Control Service that does not have Astra Trident previously installed, the cluster will be marked as `Eligible`. After you link:../get-started/add-first-cluster.html[add the cluster to Astra Control], Astra Control Provisioner will be automatically enabled. 

If your cluster is not marked `Eligible`, it will be marked `Partially eligible` because of one of the following:

* It's using an older version of Astra Trident
* It's using an Astra Trident 23.10 that does not yet have the provisioner option enabled
* It's a cluster type that does not allow automatic enablement

For `Partially eligible` cases, use these instructions to manually enable Astra Control Provisioner for your cluster.

.Before you enable Astra Control Provisioner

If you have an existing Astra Trident without Astra Control Provisioner and want to enable Astra Control Provisioner, do the following first:

* *If you have Astra Trident installed, confirm that its version is within a four-release window*: You can perform a direct upgrade to Astra Trident 24.02 with Astra Control Provisioner if your Astra Trident is within a four-release window of version 24.02. For example, you can directly upgrade from Astra Trident 23.04 to 24.02.

* *Confirm that your cluster has an AMD64 system architecture*: The Astra Control Provisioner image is provided in both AMD64 and ARM64 CPU architectures, but only AMD64 is supported by Astra Control.

.Steps

. Access the NetApp Astra Control image registry:

=====

.. Log on to the Astra Control Service UI and record your Astra Control account ID.

... Select the figure icon at the top right of the page. 
... Select *API access*. 
... Write down your account ID.

.. From the same page, select *Generate API token* and copy the API token string to the clipboard and save it in your editor.

.. Log into the Astra Control registry using your preferred method:
+
[source,docker]
----
docker login cr.astra.netapp.io -u <account-id> -p <api-token>
----
+
[source,crane]
----
crane auth login cr.astra.netapp.io -u <account-id> -p <api-token>
----
=====

. (Custom registries only) Follow these steps to move the image to your custom registry. If you aren't using a registry, follow the Trident operator steps in the <<no-registry,next section>>.
+
NOTE: You can use Podman instead of Docker for the following commands. If you are using a Windows environment, PowerShell is recommended.

. Pull the Astra Control Provisioner image from the registry:
+
NOTE: The image pulled will not support multiple platforms and will only support the same platform as the host that pulled the image, such as Linux AMD64.
+
[source,console]
----
docker pull cr.astra.netapp.io/astra/trident-acp:24.02.0 --platform <cluster platform>
----
+
Example:
+
----
docker pull cr.astra.netapp.io/astra/trident-acp:24.02.0 --platform linux/amd64
----

. Tag the image:
+
[source,console]
----
docker tag cr.astra.netapp.io/astra/trident-acp:24.02.0 <my_custom_registry>/trident-acp:24.02.0
----

. Push the image to your custom registry:
+
[source,console]
----
docker push <my_custom_registry>/trident-acp:24.02.0
----
--
// end docker tab block

.Crane
--

. Copy the Astra Control Provisioner manifest to your custom registry:
+
[source,crane]
----
crane copy cr.astra.netapp.io/astra/trident-acp:24.02.0 <my_custom_registry>/trident-acp:24.02.0
----
--
// end crane tab block
====

. Determine if the original Astra Trident installation method used an https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-managing-k8s/uninstall-trident.html#determine-the-original-installation-method[operator (either manually or with Helm) or `tridentctl`^].

. Enable Astra Control Provisioner in Astra Trident using the installation method you used originally:
+
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/astra-control-center/main/_include/enable-acp-options-tabbed-block.adoc[]

.Result

Astra Control Provisioner functionality is enabled and you can use any features available for the version you are running.

After Astra Control Provisioner is installed, the cluster hosting the provisioner in the Astra Control UI will show an `ACP version` rather than `Trident version` field and current installed version number.
