summary: Astra Control Service provides two ways of billing for your namespaces. The Free Plan enables you to manage up to 10 apps in your account. If you want to manage more than 10 namespaces, then you'll need to set up billing by upgrading from the Free Plan to the Premium Plan. Or, you can manage billing for Azure or AWS through the Azure or AWS marketplace.

You can use one of two methods to manage your Astra Control Service account billing. If you are using Azure or Amazon AWS, you can subscribe to an Astra Control Service plan through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace or the AWS Marketplace. When you do this, you can manage your billing details through the Marketplace. Or, you can sign up directly with NetApp. If you sign up with NetApp, you can manage your billing details through Astra Control Service. If you use Astra Control Service without a subscription, you are automatically subscribed to the Free Plan.

The Astra Control Service Free Plan enables you to manage up to 10 namespaces in your account. If you want to manage more than 10 namespaces, then you'll need to set up billing by upgrading from the Free Plan to the Premium Plan, or subscribe through the Azure Marketplace or AWS Marketplace.

== Billing overview

There are two types of costs associated with using Astra Control Service: charges from NetApp for the Astra Control Service and charges from your cloud provider for persistent volumes and object storage.

=== Astra Control Service billing

Astra Control Service offers three plans:

Free Plan:: Manage up to 10 namespaces for free.
Premium PayGo:: Manage an unlimited amount of namespaces at a specific rate per hour, per namespace.
Premium Subscription:: Pre-pay at a discounted rate with an annual subscription that enables you to manage up to 10 namespaces per _namespace pack_. Contact NetApp Sales to purchase as many packs as needed for your organization. For example, purchase 3 packs to manage 30 namespaces from Astra Control Service. If you manage more namespaces than allowed by your annual subscription, then you'll be charged at the subscription-dependent overage rate per extra namespace.
+
If you don't have an Astra Control account yet, purchasing the Premium Subscription automatically creates an Astra Control account for you. If you have an existing Free Plan, then you're automatically converted to the Premium Subscription.

When you create an Astra Control account, you're automatically signed up for the Free Plan. Astra Control's Dashboard shows you how many namespaces you're currently managing out of the 10 free namespaces that you're allowed. Billing starts for a namespace when the first app containing the namespace is managed, and stops for that namespace when the last app containing the namespace is unmanaged.

If you try to manage an 11th namespace, Astra Control notifies you that you've reached the limit of the Free Plan. It then prompts you to upgrade from the Free Plan to a Premium Plan. You'll be charged at the subscription-dependent overage rate per extra namespace.

You can upgrade to a Premium Plan at any time. After you upgrade, Astra Control starts charging you for _all_ namespaces in the account. The first 10 namespaces don't stay in the Free Plan.
