Add and remove cloud provider credentials from your account at any time. Astra uses these credentials to discover Kubernetes compute, the apps on the compute, and to provision resources on your behalf.

Note that all users in Astra share the same sets of credentials.

== Add credentials

The most common way to add credentials to Astra is when you manage compute, but you can also add credentials from the Account page. The credentials will then be available to choose when you manage additional Kubernetes compute.

.What you'll need

* For GKE, you should have the service account key file for a service account that has the required permissions. link:../get-started/set-up-google-cloud.html[Learn how to set up a service account].

* For AKS, you should have the JSON file that contains the output from the Azure CLI when you created the service principal. link:../get-started/set-up-microsoft-azure.html[Learn how to set up a service principal].
+
You'll also need your Azure subscription ID, if you didn't add it to the JSON file.

.Steps

. Click *Account > Credentials*.

. Click *Add Credentials*.

. Select either *Microsoft Azure* or *Google Cloud Platform*.

. Enter a name for the credentials that distinguishes them from other credentials in Astra.

. Provide the required credentials.

.. *Microsoft Azure*: Provide Astra with details about your Azure service principal by uploading a JSON file or by pasting the contents of that JSON file from your clipboard.
+
The JSON file should contain the output from the Azure CLI when you created the service principal. It can also include your subscription ID so it's automatically added to Astra. Otherwise, you need to manually enter the ID after providing the JSON.

.. *Google Cloud Platform*: Provide the Google Cloud service account key file either by uploading the file or by pasting the contents from your clipboard.

. Click *Add Credentials*.

.Result

The credentials are now available to select when you add compute to Astra.

== Remove credentials

Remove credentials from an account at any time. You should only remove credentials after link:unmanage.html[unmanaging all compute].

NOTE: The first set of credentials that you add to Astra is always in use because Astra uses the credentials to authenticate to the backup bucket. It's best not to remove these credentials.

.Steps

. Click *Account > Credentials*.

. Click the drop-down list in the *State* column for the credentials that you want to remove.

. Click *Remove*.

.Result

Astra removes the credentials from the account.
