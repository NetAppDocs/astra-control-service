[.lead]
Astra Control can restore your application from a snapshot or backup. Restoring from an existing snapshot will be faster when restoring the application to the same cluster. You can use the Astra Control UI or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[the Astra Control API^] to restore apps.

NOTE: Any member user with namespace constraints by namespace name/ID or by namespace labels can clone or restore an app to a new namespace on the same cluster or to any other cluster in their organizationâ€™s account. However, the same user cannot access the cloned or restored app in the new namespace. After a new namespace is created by a clone or restore operation, the account admin/owner can edit the member user account and update role constraints for the affected user to grant access to the new namespace.

.Steps

. Select *Applications* and then select the name of a managed app.

. Select *Data protection*.

. If you want to restore from a snapshot, keep *Snapshots* selected. Otherwise, select *Backups* to restore from a backup.

. Select *Restore application*.

. *Restore details*: Specify details for the restored app. To restore an app in-place (revert an app to an earlier version of itself), choose the same namespace and destination cluster that it is currently running in:
+
* Enter a namespace for the app.
* Choose the destination cluster for the app.
* Click *Review*.
+
NOTE: If you restore to a namespace that was previously deleted, a new namespace with the same name is created as part of the restore process. Any users that had rights to manage apps in the previously deleted namespace need to manually restore rights to the newly re-created namespace.

. *Restore Summary*: Review details about the restore action, type "restore", and select *Restore*.

.Result

Astra Control restores the app based on the information that you provided. If you restored the app in-place, the associated persistent volumes are deleted and recreated.
