After you link:../get-started/add-first-cluster.html[add Kubernetes compute to Astra], you can install apps on the cluster (outside of Astra), and then go to the Apps page in Astra to start managing the apps.

== Install apps on your cluster

Now that you've added your compute to Astra, you can install apps on the cluster. Persistent volumes will be provisioned on the new storage classes by default. After the pods are online, you can manage the app with Astra.

Astra will manage stateful apps only if the storage is on a storage class installed by Astra.

== Manage apps

Astra enables you to manage your apps at the namespace level or by Kubernetes label.

=== Manage apps by namespace

The *Discovered* section of the Apps page shows namespaces and the Helm-installed apps or custom-labeled apps in those namespaces. You can choose to manage each app individually or at the namespace level. It all comes down to the level of granularity that you need for data protection operations.

For example, you might want to set a backup policy for "maria" that has a weekly cadence, but you might need to back up "mariadb" (which is in the same namespace) more frequently than that. Based on those needs, you would need to manage the apps separately and not under a single namespace.

While Astra allows you to separately manage both levels of the hierarchy (the namespace and the apps in that namespace), the best practice is to choose one or the other. Actions that you take in Astra can fail if the actions take place at the same time at both the namespace and app level.

.Steps

. Click *Apps* and then click *Discovered*.

. View the list of discovered namespaces and expand a namespace to view the apps and associated resources.
+
Astra shows you Helm apps and custom-labeled apps in namespace. If Helm labels are available, they're designated with a tag icon.
+
Here's an example with one app in a namespace:
+

. Decide whether you want to manage each app individually or at the namespace level.

. At the desired level in the hierarchy, click the drop-down list in the *Actions* column and click *Manage*.
+

. If you don't want to manage an app, click the drop-down list in the *Actions* column for the desired app and click *Ignore*.
+
For example, if you wanted to manage all apps under the "mysql-test" namespace together so that they have the same snapshot and backup policies, you would manage the namespace and ignore the apps in the namespace:
+

.Result

Apps that you chose to manage are now available from the *Managed* tab. Any ignored apps will move to the *Ignored* tab. Ideally, the Discovered tab will show zero apps, so that as new apps are installed, they are easier to find and manage.

=== Manage apps by Kubernetes label

Astra includes an action at the top of the Apps page named *Define custom app*. You can use this action to manage apps that are identified with a Kubernetes label. link:../learn/define-custom-app.html[Learn more about defining apps by Kubernetes label].

.Steps

. Click *Apps > Define custom app*.

. In the *Define Custom Application* dialog box, provide the required information to manage the app:

.. *New App*: Enter the display name of the app.

.. *Compute*: Select the compute where the app resides.

.. *Namespace:* Select the namespace for the app.

.. *Label:* Enter a label or select a label from the resources below.

.. *Selected Resources*: View and manage the selected Kubernetes resources that you'd like to protect (pods, secrets, persistent volumes, and more).
+
Here's an example:
+
image:screenshot-selected-resources.gif[]
+
** View the available labels by expanding a resource and clicking the number of labels.
+
image:screenshot-view-labels.gif[]
+
** Select one of the labels.
+
image:screenshot-select-label.gif[]
+
After you choose a label, it displays in the *Label* field. Astra also updates the *Unselected Resources* section to show the resources that don't match the selected label.

.. *Unselected Resources*: Verify the app resources that you don't want to protect.
+

. Click *Define Custom App*.

.Result

Astra enables management of the app. You can now find it in the *Managed* tab.

== What about system apps?

Astra also discovers the system apps running on a Kubernetes cluster. You can view them by filtering the Apps list.

We don't show you these system apps by default because it's rare that you'd need to back them up.
