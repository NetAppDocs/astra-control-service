After you link:../get-started/add-first-cluster.html[add a Kubernetes cluster to Astra Control], you can install apps on the cluster (outside of Astra Control), and then go to the Apps page in Astra Control to start managing the apps.

== App management requirements
Astra Control has the following app management requirements:

//* *Licensing*: You need an Astra Control Center license to manage apps using Astra Control Center.
* *Helm 3*: If you use Helm to deploy apps, Astra Control requires Helm version 3. Managing and cloning apps deployed with Helm 3 (or upgraded from Helm 2 to Helm 3) are fully supported. Managing apps deployed with Helm 2 is not supported.
//* *Operator management*: Astra Control Center does not support apps that are deployed with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)-enabled operators or cluster-scoped operators.
* *Operator-deployed apps*: Astra Control supports the following apps deployed with namespace-scoped operators:
** https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/tree/v1.7.1[Apache Cassandra^]
** https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-operator[Jenkins CI^]
** https://github.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator[Percona XtraDB Cluster^]

NOTE: Only one operator-deployed app is supported per namespace. An operator and the app it deploys must use the same namespace; you might need to modify the deployment .yaml file for the operator to ensure this is the case.

== Install apps on your cluster

Now that you've added your cluster to Astra Control, you can install apps on the cluster. Persistent volumes will be provisioned on the new storage classes by default. After the pods are online, you can manage the app with Astra Control.

Astra Control will manage stateful apps only if the storage is on a storage class installed by Astra Control.

== Manage apps

When Astra Control discovers the apps running on your clusters, they are unmanaged until you choose how you want to manage them. A managed application in Astra Control can be any of the following:

* A namespace, including all resources in that namespace
+

* An individual application deployed with helm3 within a namespace
+
image:diagram-managed-app2.png[A conceptual image that shows Astra managing an individual application deployed in a namespace that includes other applications.]

* A group of resources that are identified by a Kubernetes label (this is called a _custom app_ in Astra Control)
+
image:diagram-managed-app3.png[A conceptual image that shows Astra managing a custom app based on a Kubernetes label.]

The sections below describe how to manage your apps using these options.

=== Manage apps by namespace

The *Discovered* section of the Apps page shows namespaces and the Helm-installed apps or custom-labeled apps in those namespaces. You can choose to manage each app individually or at the namespace level. It all comes down to the level of granularity that you need for data protection operations.

For example, you might want to set a backup policy for "maria" that has a weekly cadence, but you might need to back up "mariadb" (which is in the same namespace) more frequently than that. Based on those needs, you would need to manage the apps separately and not under a single namespace.

While Astra Control allows you to separately manage both levels of the hierarchy (the namespace and the apps in that namespace), the best practice is to choose one or the other. Actions that you take in Astra Control can fail if the actions take place at the same time at both the namespace and app level.

.Steps

. Click *Apps* and then click *Discovered*.
+

. View the list of discovered namespaces and expand a namespace to view the apps and associated resources.
+
Astra Control shows you Helm apps and custom-labeled apps in namespace. If Helm labels are available, they're designated with a tag icon.
+
Here's an example with two apps in a namespace:
+
image:screenshot-group.gif[A screenshot of the Apps page where a namespace is expanded to show two apps in that namespace.]

. Decide whether you want to manage each app individually or at the namespace level.

. At the desired level in the hierarchy, click the drop-down list in the *Actions* column and click *Manage*.
+
image:screenshot-app-manage.gif["A screenshot of an expanded drop-down list in the Apps page where you can choose to manage or ignore a namespace or app."]

. If you don't want to manage an app, click the drop-down list in the *Actions* column for the desired app and click *Ignore*.
+
For example, if you wanted to manage all apps under the "jenkins" namespace together so that they have the same snapshot and backup policies, you would manage the namespace and ignore the apps in the namespace:
+
image:screenshot-app-manage-and-ignore.gif["A screenshot of an expanded drop-down list in the Apps page where you can choose to manage or ignore a namespace or app."]

.Result

Apps that you chose to manage are now available from the *Managed* tab. Any ignored apps will move to the *Ignored* tab. Ideally, the Discovered tab will show zero apps, so that as new apps are installed, they are easier to find and manage.

=== Manage apps by Kubernetes label

Astra Control includes an action at the top of the Apps page named *Define custom app*. You can use this action to manage apps that are identified with a Kubernetes label. link:../learn/define-custom-app.html[Learn more about defining apps by Kubernetes label].

.Steps

. Click *Apps > Define custom app*.

. In the *Define Custom Application* dialog box, provide the required information to manage the app:

.. *New App*: Enter the display name of the app.

.. *Cluster*: Select the cluster where the app resides.

.. *Namespace:* Select the namespace for the app.

.. *Label:* Enter a label or select a label from the resources below.

.. *Selected Resources*: View and manage the selected Kubernetes resources that you'd like to protect (pods, secrets, persistent volumes, and more).
+
Here's an example:
+
image:screenshot-selected-resources.gif["A screenshot of the resources that you can protect, such as config maps and persistent volume claims."]
+
** View the available labels by expanding a resource and clicking the number of labels.
+
image:screenshot-view-labels.gif["A screenshot that shows a resource expanded and the number of labels for that resource."]
+
** Select one of the labels.
+
image:screenshot-select-label.gif[A screenshot that shows the list of labels that you can choose from after you click the number of labels.]
+
After you choose a label, it displays in the *Label* field. Astra Control also updates the *Unselected Resources* section to show the resources that don't match the selected label.

.. *Unselected Resources*: Verify the app resources that you don't want to protect.
+
image:screenshot-selected-label.gif[A screenshot that shows a label in the Label field after you select a label from the Resources pane.]

. Click *Define Custom App*.

.Result

Astra Control enables management of the app. You can now find it in the *Managed* tab.

== What about system apps?

Astra Control also discovers the system apps running on a Kubernetes cluster. You can view them by filtering the Apps list.

image:screenshot-system-apps.gif[A screenshot that shows the Show System Apps option that is available when you click All Clusters in the Apps screen.]

We don't show you these system apps by default because it's rare that you'd need to back them up.
