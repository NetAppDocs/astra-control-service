Protect your apps by taking snapshots and backups using an automated protection policy or on an ad-hoc basis. You can use the Astra UI or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[the Astra Control API^] to protect apps.

Learn more about link:../learn/data-protection.html[data protection in Astra Control^].

You can do the following tasks related to protecting your app data:

* <<Configure a protection policy>>
* <<Create a snapshot>>
* <<Create a backup>>
* <<View snapshots and backups>>
* <<Delete snapshots>>
* <<Cancel backups>>
* <<Delete backups>>

== Configure a protection policy

A protection policy protects an app by creating snapshots, backups, or both at a defined schedule. You can choose to create snapshots and backups hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly, and you can specify the number of copies to retain. 

If you need backups or snapshots to run more frequently than once per hour, you can https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/workflows/workflows_before.html[use the Astra Control REST API to create snapshots and backups^].

IMPORTANT: If your app uses a storage class backed by the `ontap-nas-economy` driver, protection policies cannot be used. Use an alternate storage class if you want a protection policy. 

.Steps

. Select *Applications* and then select the name of a managed app.

. Select *Data Protection*.

. Select *Configure Protection Policy*.

. Define a protection schedule by choosing the number of snapshots and backups to keep for the hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly schedules.
+
You can define the hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly schedules concurrently. A schedule won't turn active until you set a retention level for snapshots and backups.
+
When you set a retention level for backups, you can choose the bucket where you'd like to store the backups.
+
The following example sets four protection schedules: hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly for snapshots and backups.

. Select *Review*.

. Select *Set Protection Policy*.

.Result

Astra Control implements the data protection policy by creating and retaining snapshots and backups using the schedule and retention policy that you defined.

== Create a snapshot

You can create an on-demand snapshot at any time.

IMPORTANT: If your app uses a storage class backed by the `ontap-nas-economy` driver, snapshots cannot be used. Use an alternate storage class for snapshots. 

.Steps

. Select *Applications*.

. From the Options menu in the *Actions* column for the desired app, select *Snapshot*.
//+
//image:screenshot-create-snapshot.gif["A screenshot of the app page where you can select the drop-down list in the actions column and select Snapshot."]

. Customize the name of the snapshot and then select *Next*.

. Review the snapshot summary and select *Snapshot*.

.Result

The snapshot process begins. A snapshot is successful when the status is *Healthy* in the *State* column on the *Data protection* > *Snapshots* page.

== Create a backup

You can also back up an app at any time.

IMPORTANT: If your app uses a storage class backed by the `ontap-nas-economy` driver, backups are disruptive and the app will be unavailable until the backup operation has completed.

Be aware of how storage space is handled when you back up an application hosted on Azure NetApp Files storage. Refer to link:../learn/azure-storage.html#application-backups[Application backups] for more information.

.Steps

. Select *Applications*.

. From the Options menu in the *Actions* column for the desired app, select *Back up*.
//+
//image:screenshot-create-backup.gif["A screenshot of the app page where you can select the drop-down list in the actions column and select Backup."]

. Customize the name of the backup.
. Choose whether to back up the app from an existing snapshot. If you select this option, you can choose from a list of existing snapshots.
. Choose a destination bucket for the backup from the list of storage buckets.
. Select *Next*.
. Review the backup summary and select *Back up*.

.Result

Astra Control creates a backup of the app.

NOTE: If you need to cancel a running backup, use the instructions in <<Cancel backups>>. To delete the backup, wait until it has completed and then use the instructions in <<Delete backups>>.

== View snapshots and backups

You can view the snapshots and backups of an app from the Data Protection tab.

.Steps

. Select *Applications* and then select the name of a managed app.

. Select *Data Protection*.
+
The snapshots display by default.

. Select *Backups* to refer to the list of backups.

== Delete snapshots

Delete the scheduled or on-demand snapshots that you no longer need.

.Steps

. Select *Applications* and then select the name of a managed app.

. Select *Data Protection*.

. From the Options menu in the *Actions* column for the desired snapshot, select *Delete snapshot*.
//+
//image:screenshot-delete-snapshot.gif[A screenshot of the Data protection tab for an app where you can delete a snapshot.]

. Type the word "delete" to confirm deletion and then select *Yes, Delete snapshot*.

.Result

Astra Control deletes the snapshot.

== Cancel backups

You can cancel a backup that is in progress.

TIP: To cancel a backup, the backup must be in `Running` state. You cannot cancel a backup that is in `Pending` state.

.Steps

. Select *Applications* and then select the name of an app.
. Select *Data Protection*.
. Select *Backups*.
//+
//image:screenshot-data-protection-backups.gif[A screenshot of the Backups option that's available in the far right of the data protection tab.]

. From the Options menu in the *Actions* column for the desired backup, select *Cancel*.
. Type the word "cancel" to confirm the operation and then select *Yes, cancel backup*.


== Delete backups

Delete the scheduled or on-demand backups that you no longer need.

NOTE: If you need to cancel a running backup, use the instructions in <<Cancel backups>>. To delete the backup, wait until it has completed and then use these instructions.

.Steps

. Select *Applications* and then select the name of an app.

. Select *Data Protection*.

. Select *Backups*.
