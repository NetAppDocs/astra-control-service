Protect your apps by taking snapshots and backups using an automated protection policy or on an ad-hoc basis.

== Snapshots and backups

A _snapshot_ is a point-in-time copy of an app that's stored on the same provisioned volume as the app. They are usually fast. Local snapshots are used to restore the application to an earlier point in time.

A _backup_ is stored on object storage in the cloud. A backup can be slower to take compared to the local snapshots. But they can be accessed across regions in the cloud to enable app migrations. You can also choose a longer retention period for backups.

CAUTION: _You can't be fully protected until you have a recent backup_. This is important because backups are stored in an object store away from the persistent volumes. If a failure or accident damages the cluster and its persistent storage, then you need a backup to recover. A snapshot wouldn't enable you to recover.

== Configure a protection policy

A protection policy protects an app by creating snapshots, backups, or both at a defined schedule. You can choose to create snapshots and backups hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly, and you can specify the number of copies to retain. If you need backups or snapshots to run more frequently than once per hour, you can https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/workflows/workflows_before.html[use the Astra Control REST API to create snapshots and backups^].

.Steps

. Select *Applications* and then select the name of a managed app.

. Select *Data Protection*.

. Select *Configure Protection Policy*.

. Define a protection schedule by choosing the number of snapshots and backups to keep for the hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly schedules.
+
You can define the hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly schedules concurrently. A schedule won't turn active until you set a retention level for snapshots and backups.
+
When you set a retention level for backups, you can choose the bucket where you'd like to store the backups.
+
The following example sets four protection schedules: hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly for snapshots and backups.

. Select *Review*.

. Select *Configure*.

.Result

Astra Control implements the data protection policy by creating and retaining snapshots and backups using the schedule and retention policy that you defined.

== Create a snapshot

You can create an on-demand snapshot at any time.

.Steps

. Select *Applications*.

. Select the drop-down list in the *Actions* column for the desired app.

. Select *Snapshot*.
//+
//image:screenshot-create-snapshot.gif["A screenshot of the app page where you can select the drop-down list in the actions column and select Snapshot."]

. Customize the name of the snapshot and then select *Review Information*.

. Review the snapshot summary and select *Snapshot App*.

.Result

Astra Control creates a snapshot of the apps.

== Create a backup

You can also back up an app at any time.

.Steps

. Select *Applications*.

. Select the drop-down list in the *Actions* column for the desired app.

. Select *Backup*.
//+
//image:screenshot-create-backup.gif["A screenshot of the app page where you can select the drop-down list in the actions column and select Backup."]

. Customize the name of the backup, choose whether to back up the app from an existing snapshot, and then select *Review Information*.

. Review the backup summary and select *Backup App*.

.Result

Astra Control creates a backup of the app.

== View snapshots and backups

You can view the snapshots and backups of an app from the Data Protection tab.

.Steps

. Select *Applications* and then select the name of a managed app.

. Select *Data Protection*.
+
The snapshots display by default.

. Select *Backups* to see the list of backups.

== Delete snapshots

Delete the scheduled or on-demand snapshots that you no longer need.

.Steps

. Select *Applications* and then select the name of a managed app.

. Select *Data Protection*.

. Select the drop-down list in the *Actions* column for the desired snapshot.

. Select *Delete snapshot*.
//+
//image:screenshot-delete-snapshot.gif[A screenshot of the Data protection tab for an app where you can delete a snapshot.]

. Type the name of the snapshot to confirm deletion and then select *Yes, Delete snapshot*.

.Result

Astra Control deletes the snapshot.

== Delete backups

Delete the scheduled or on-demand backups that you no longer need.

. Select *Applications* and then select the name of a managed app.

. Select *Data Protection*.
