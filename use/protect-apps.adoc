Protect your apps by taking snapshots and backups using an automated protection policy or on an ad-hoc basis.

== Snapshots and backups

A _snapshot_ is a point-in-time copy of an app that's stored on the same provisioned volume as the app. They are usually fast. Local snapshots are used to restore the application to an earlier point in time.

A _backup_ is stored on object storage in the cloud. A backup can be slower to take compared to the local snapshots. But they can be accessed across regions in the cloud to enable app migrations. You can also choose a longer retention period for backups.

CAUTION: _You can't be fully protected until you have a recent backup_. This is important because backups are stored in an object store away from the persistent volumes. If a failure or accident wipes out the cluster and it's persistent storage, then you need a backup to recover. A snapshot wouldn't enable you to recover.

== Configure a protection policy

A protection policy protects an app by creating snapshots, backups, or both at a defined schedule. You can choose to create snapshots and backups hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly, and you can specify the number of copies to retain.

.Steps

. Click *Apps* and then click the name of a managed app.

. Click *Data Protection*.

. Click *Configure Protection Policy*.

. Define a protection schedule by choosing the number of snapshots and backups to keep hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly.
+
You can define the hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly schedules concurrently. A schedule won't turn active until you set a retention level.
+
The following example sets four protection schedules: hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly for snapshots and backups.

. Click *Review Information*.

. Click *Set Protection Policy.*

.Result

Astra implements the data protection policy by creating and retaining snapshots and backups using the schedule and retention policy that you defined.

== Create a snapshot

You can create an on-demand snapshot at any time.

.Steps

. Click *Apps*.

.Result

Astra creates a snapshot of the apps.

. Review the backup summary and click *Backup App*.

.Result

Astra creates a backup of the app.
