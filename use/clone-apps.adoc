summary: Clone an existing app to create a duplicate app on the same Kubernetes cluster or on another cluster. Cloning can help if you need to move applications and storage from one Kubernetes cluster to another. For example, you might want to move workloads through a CI CD pipeline and across Kubernetes namespaces.

You can clone an existing app to create a duplicate app on the same Kubernetes cluster or on another cluster. When Astra Control clones an app, it creates a clone of your application configuration and persistent storage.

Cloning can help if you need to move applications and storage from one Kubernetes cluster to another. For example, you might want to move workloads through a CI/CD pipeline and across Kubernetes namespaces.
//DOC-3595/ASTRACTL-10071/Q2 and PI4

NOTE: If you add a namespace filter to an execution hook that runs after a restore or clone operation and the restore or clone source and destination are in different namespaces, the namespace filter is only applied to the destination namespace.

.What you'll need

* To clone apps to a different cluster, you need to make sure that you have assigned a default bucket for the cloud instance containing the source cluster. If the source cloud instance does not have a default bucket set, the cross-cluster clone operation will fail.

* During clone operations, apps that need an IngressClass resource or webhooks to function properly must not have those resources already defined on the destination cluster.

.Clone limitations

* *Explicit Storage classes*: If you deploy an app with a storage class explicitly set and you need to clone the app, the target cluster must have the originally specified storage class. Cloning an application with an explicitly set storage class to a cluster that does not have the same storage class will fail.
* *ontap-nas-economy-backed storage class*: If your app uses a storage class backed by the `ontap-nas-economy` driver, the backup portion of a clone operation is disruptive. The source application is not available until the backup is complete. The restore portion of the clone operation is non-disruptive.
* *Clones and user constraints*: Any member user with namespace constraints by namespace name/ID or by namespace labels can clone or restore an app to a new namespace on the same cluster or to any other cluster in their organization's account. However, the same user cannot access the cloned or restored app in the new namespace. After a new namespace is created by a clone or restore operation, the account admin/owner can edit the member user account and update role constraints for the affected user to grant access to the new namespace.
* *Clones use default buckets*: 
** During an app backup or app restore, you can specify a bucket to use. You need to specify a default bucket when you clone across clusters, but specifying a bucket is optional when cloning within the same cluster. 
** When you clone across clusters, the cloud instance containing the source cluster of the clone operation must have a default bucket set. 
** There is no option to change buckets for a clone. If you want control over which bucket is used, you can either link:../use/manage-buckets.html#edit-a-bucket[change the bucket default] or do a link:../use/protect-apps.html#create-a-backup[backup] followed by a link:../use/restore-apps.html[restore] separately.
* *With Jenkins CI*: If you clone an operator-deployed instance of Jenkins CI, you need to manually restore the persistent data. This is a limitation of the app's deployment model.

.Steps

. Select *Applications*.
. Do one of the following:
+
* Select the Options menu in the *Actions* column for the desired app.
* Select the name of the desired app, and select the status drop-down list at the top right of the page.
. Select *Clone*.
//+
//image:screenshot-create-clone.gif["A screenshot of the app page where you can select the drop-down list in the actions column and select Clone."]

. Specify details for the clone:
+
* Enter a name.
* Choose a destination cluster for the clone.
* Enter destination namespaces for the clone. Each source namespace associated with the app maps to a destination namespace.
+
NOTE: Astra Control creates new destination namespaces as part of the clone operation. Destination namespaces that you specify must not be already present on the destination cluster.

* Select *Next*.
* Choose whether you want to create the clone from an existing snapshot or backup. If you don't select this option, Astra Control creates the clone from the app's current state.
** If you chose to clone from an existing snapshot or backup, choose the snapshot or backup that you'd like to use.
* Select *Next*.
* Choose to keep the original storage class associated with the app or select a different storage class.
+
NOTE: If you select a different storage class and this storage class doesn't exist at the moment of restore, an error will be returned.

. Select *Next*.
. Review the information about the clone and select *Clone*.

.Result

Astra Control clones the app based on the information that you provided. The clone operation is successful when the new app clone is in `Healthy` state on the *Applications* page.

After a new namespace is created by a clone or restore operation, the account admin/owner can edit the member user account and update role constraints for the affected user to grant access to the new namespace.
