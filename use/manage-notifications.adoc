Astra Control notifies you when actions have completed or failed. For example, you'll see a notification if a backup of an app completed successfully.

The number of unread notifications is available in the top right of the interface:

You can view these notifications and mark them as read (this can come in handy if you like to clear unread notifications like we do).

.Steps
