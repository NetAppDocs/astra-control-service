Here is an overview of the various components of the Astra Control environment.

== Astra Control components

* *Kubernetes clusters*: Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. Astra provides management services for applications hosted in a Kubernetes cluster.

* *Astra Trident*: As a fully supported open source storage provisioner and orchestrator maintained by NetApp, Trident enables you to create storage volumes for containerized applications managed by Docker and Kubernetes. When deployed with Astra Control Center, Trident includes a configured ONTAP storage backend, and also supports Astra Data Store as a storage backend.

* *Storage backend*:
ifdef::gcp+azure+aws[]
** Astra Control Service uses the following storage backends:
*** https://www.netapp.com/cloud-services/cloud-volumes-service-for-google-cloud/[NetApp Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud^] or Google Persistent Disk as the storage backends for GKE clusters
*** https://www.netapp.com/cloud-services/azure-netapp-files/[Azure NetApp Files^] or Azure Managed Disks as the storage backends for AKS clusters
*** https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/[Amazon Elastic Block Store^] or https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx] as the storage backends for AWS clusters
endif::gcp+azure+aws[]

** Astra Control Service uses https://www.netapp.com/cloud-services/azure-netapp-files/[Azure NetApp Files^] or Azure Managed Disks as the storage backends for AKS clusters.

** Astra Control Service uses https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/[Amazon Elastic Block Store^] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx] as the storage backends for AWS clusters.

** Astra Control Center uses the following storage backends:

*** Astra Data Store storage backend
*** ONTAP AFF and FAS storage backend. As a storage software and hardware platform, ONTAP provides core storage services, support for multiple storage access protocols, and storage management functionality, such as snapshots and mirroring.
//*** SolidFire storage backend. When you use a SolidFire storage backend, Astra Control Center doesn't report statistics and storage backend status as it does with other storage backends.
*** Cloud Volumes ONTAP storage backend


* *Cloud Insights*:  A NetApp cloud infrastructure monitoring tool, Cloud Insights enables you to monitor performance and utilization for your Kubernetes clusters managed by Astra Control Center. Cloud Insights correlates storage usage to workloads. When you enable the Cloud Insights connection in Astra Control Center, telemetry information shows in Astra Control Center UI pages.

== Astra Control interfaces

You can complete tasks using different interfaces:

* *Web user interface (UI)*: Both Astra Control Service and Astra Control Center use the same web-based UI where you can manage, migrate and protect apps. Use the UI also to manage user accounts and configuration settings.

* *API*: Both Astra Control Service and Astra Control Center use the same Astra Control API. Using the API, you can perform the same tasks that you would using the UI.

Astra Control Center also enables you to manage, migrate, and protect Kubernetes clusters running within VM environments.
