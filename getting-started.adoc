== Provision a Cluster Using GKE

Evaluating Project Astra requires one or more GKE clusters. There are multiple ways to provision a cluster that will work with Project Astra. This is one method using the Google Cloud Platform web UI.

Log into the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Platform Console]

Please confirm that you have the correct project selected. The current project is highlighted in yellow in the image below.

image::gcp-gke-dashboard.png[GCP GKE Dashboard]

Use the left navigation menu to choose *Kubernetes Engine->Clusters*

Use the *+Create Cluster* link to start configuring a GKE cluster.

image::gcp-gke-cluster-basics.png[GCP GKE Cluster Basics]

Give your cluster a name or accept the supplied value.

In order to access GCP CVS, the cluster must be provisioned one of these zones.

* us-east4
* us-central1
* us-west2

The location should remain set to *Zonal*. Make a selection under "Location type" by choosing your preferred *Zone* from the drop-down.

Project Astra utilizes features that are only available in Kubernetes v1.17 and higher. As of this writing, Kubernetes 1.17 is not available as a selectable option in the default "Static version" drop-down menu.

In the "Master version" section, activate the *Release channel* radio button and then choose *Rapid channel-1.17.5-gke-0*. The exact value will change as Google deploys new releases of Kubernetes.

Using the left navigation menu, expand *default-pool* under "NODE POOLS" and select *Nodes*.

image::gcp-gke-nodes.png[GCP GKE Nodes]

Under "Image type" select *Ubuntu*.

You are welcome to adjust the other values as you see fit. The defaults should work fine for evaluating Project Astra.

TIP: Before hitting the "CREATE" button, you may want to switch to the "Metadata" section (under CLUSTER, not NODE POOLS) and add one or more labels to this cluster.

image::gcp-gke-metadata-labels.png[GCP GKE Metadata Labels]

In the example image, a label has been added with `creator` as the key.

When you are done with the configuration, press the *CREATE* button to continue.

Once the cluster has been provisioned it will appear in the list.

== Register the Cluster with Project Astra

For best results, please use the Chrome browser when evaluating Project Astra.

You will be invited into a Project Astra organization by an existing user.

The invitation will come via e-mail and contains a link. You'll need to have avalid https://cloud.netapp.com[Cloud Central] account matching the e-mailaddress that was invited in order to accept.

Project Astra is available at https://astra.netapp.com.

When logged in you will see the dashboard.

image::astra-welcome-dashboard.png[Astra Welcome Dashboard]

Use the left navigation menu to select *Compute* under *DATA*. The main window will either be empty or display a list of Kubernetes clusters that are already registered with Project Astra. Click the *+ Add cluster* button to begin the cluster registration process.

image::astra-compute-add-cluster.png[Astra Compute Add Cluster]

The default provider is set to "Google Cloud Platform." Microsoft Azure and AWS will be enabled at a future date.

image::astra-select-provider.png[Astra Select Provider]

"Service account JSON" is generated in the GCP console IAM section. If you have it saved as a file, use the first "Upload file" option. Choose the appropriate file and upload it. Otherwise, choose "Paste from Clipboard" or "Use existing."

"Service account name" will be automatically generated based on the `client_email` value contained in the service account JSON. You may change it if you wish. This value will appear under "Use existing" to identify this set of service account credentials.

Press the *Discover clusters* button to continue. You will see a list of Kubernetes clusters that are currently provisioned.
