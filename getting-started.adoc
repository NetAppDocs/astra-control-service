= Getting Started

This document is intended for users that are evaluating Project Astra during the
alpha phase running from June 4th to July 4th 2020.

== Requirements

A TLDR; list of items needed for the Alpa.

* Register with Cloud Central.
* Get invited to an Astra Organization.
* Provision one or more GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) cluster(s).
** Kubernetes version >= 1.17.0 (from Rapid Release Channel).
** Ubuntu worker nodes w/rpc.statd enabled.
** Zonal deployment in a CVS supported region. (us-east4, us-west2, us-central1)
* GCP Service Account token (JSON)
** Grant required Service Account permissions. (*EJK - enumerate*)
* Kubeconfig with an admin token and context

== Provision a Cluster Using GKE

Evaluating Project Astra requires one or more GKE clusters. To provision a
cluster that will work with Project Astra, please follow these steps.

Log into the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Platform Console]

Please confirm that you have the correct project selected. The current project
is circled in yellow in the image below.

image::assets/gcp-gke-dashboard.png[GCP GKE Dashboard]

Use the left navigation menu to choose **Kubernetes Engine->Clusters**

Use the "+Create Cluster" link (circled in green in the image above) to start
configuring a GKE cluster.

image::assets/gcp-gke-cluster-basics.png[GCP GKE Cluster Basics]

Give your cluster a name or accept the supplied value.

In order to access GCP CVS, the cluster must be provisioned one of these zones.

* us-east4
* us-central1
* us-west2

Make a selection under "Location type" by choosing your preferred **Zone** from
the drop-down.

Project Astra utilizes features that are only available in Kubernetes v1.17 and
higher. (*EJK - verify this language*)

In the "Master version" section, activate the "Release channel" radio button and
then choose **Rapid channel-1.17.5-gke-0**. The exact value may change as Google
releases updates.

Using the left navigation menu, expand *default-pool* under "NODE POOLS" and
select *Nodes*.

image::assets/gcp-gke-nodes.png[GCP GKE Nodes]

Under "Image type" select *Ubuntu*.

You are welcome to adjust the other values as you see fit. The defaults should
work fine.

Before hitting the "CREATE" button, you may want to switch to the "Metadata"
section (under CLUSTER, not NODE POOLS) and add one or more labels to this
cluster.

image::assets/gcp-gke-metadata-labels.png[GCP GKE Metadata Labels]

In the example image, a label has been added with *creator* as the key and a
first initial plus last name as the value. (*EJK - HCL strongly recommends this
for NetApp users*)

When you are done with the configuration, press the "CREATE" button to continue.

Once the cluster has been provisioned it will appear in the list.

== KUBECONFIG

image::assets/gcp-gke-clusters.png[GCP GKE Clusters]

Pressing the *Connect* button on the right side of the line containing your
cluster will open a window containing instructions on how to get a kubeconfig
file for accessing the cluster. This file will need to be modified and can then
used to register the cluster with Project Astra.

image::assets/gcp-gke-connect-gcloud.png[GCP GKE Connect Gcloud]

The `gcloud` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool will be used.

(*EJK - maybe there is an easier way?*)

Quickstart guides for installing and configuring `gcloud` are available from
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts[Google Cloud Docs]

(*EJK - do we want to provide per OS instructions?*)

=== MacOS

The following steps are one method for generating a kubeconfig file compatible with Project Astra.

Enter the following into a command prompt:

`curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash`

Restart your shell

Run `gcloud init` in the command prompt to initialize the gcloud environment.

If you are using zsh then you can set your local environment variable like this:

`export KUBECONFIG=/Users/username/path/cluster-name.yaml`

Verify that the file was populated.

`echo $KUBECONFIG`

`cat /Users/username/path/cluster-name.yaml`

Then run the `gcloud` command which will write out the config for the cluster to
the file specified above.

Create your service account token by running `make_sa_token_kubeconfig.sh`.

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash


CLUSTER=$(kubectl config view --flatten --minify -o=jsonpath='{range .clusters[*]}{.name}')
echo Cluster: $CLUSTER
CERT_AUTH_DATA=$(kubectl config view --flatten --minify -o=jsonpath='{range .clusters[*]}{.cluster.certificate-authority-data}')
echo Cert Auth Data: $CERT_AUTH_DATA
SERVER=$(kubectl config view --flatten --minify -o=jsonpath='{range .clusters[*]}{.cluster.server}')
echo Server: $SERVER


ACCOUNT=admin-account

kubectl apply -f - << EOF

echo Client Token: $TOKEN

*EJK-what do we do for Windows users?*


You will end up with a `kubeconfig.yaml` file that will be used when registering
the cluster with Project Astra. Here is a slightly redacted sample.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
users:
  - name: admin-account
    user:
      token: eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InRuSmd1QWU3QUtpT0dTdGNkSmZxajh4Q_uJRrd7Qu0OJFiVCgPcKoDeMTnzz4gsV84sADC60oAJWthIY4IGfA7t4ajX0WB8JS0bMVMTtjZKTsg5BvRLnsX9vqUSg

== Register the Cluster with Project Astra

For best results, please use the Chrome browser.

You will be invited into a Project Astra organization by an existing user.

The invitation will come via e-mail and contains a link. You'll need to have a
valid https://cloud.netapp.com[Cloud Central] account matching the e-mail
address that was invited in order to accept.

Project Astra is available at https://preview.astra.netapp.com during the Alpha
phase.

When logged in you are greeted with the dashboard.

image::assets/astra-credentials-add-new.png[Astra Credentials Add New]

"GCP Credential" is whatever name you want to identify the service account
credentials that are being provided below.

Service Account JSON - this is generated in the GCP console IAM section.

*EJK - Add or link to instructions for this*

Region is the location you provisioned the GKE cluster in. Select from the
drop-down.

Project number is a twelve-digit numeric value that is associated with your
project. Google provides additional details at
https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects.

You can also use `gcloud` to locate the project number.

`gcloud projects list`

"Select Compute" will take you to the next section where you will provide the
modified kubeconfig, etc.
