=== Namespace role-based access control (RBAC)
Astra Control Service now supports assigning namespace constraints to Member or Viewer users.

link:../use/manage-roles.html[Manage roles].

=== Support for private AKS clusters
You can now manage AKS clusters that use private IP addresses.

link:../get-started/add-first-cluster.html[Start managing Kubernetes clusters from Astra Control Service].

== 14 Dec 2021
This release includes the following new features and enhancements.

=== New storage backend options

=== In-place app restore
You can now restore a snapshot, clone, or backup of an app in place by restoring to the same cluster and namespace.

link:../use/restore-apps.html[Restore apps].

=== Script events with execution hooks
Astra Control supports custom scripts that you can run before or after you take a snapshot of an application. This enables you to perform tasks like suspending database transactions so that the snapshot of your database app is consistent.

link:../use/manage-app-execution-hooks.html[Manage app execution hooks].

== 5 Aug 2021

This release includes the following new features and enhancements.

=== Astra Control Center

Astra Control is now available in a new deployment model. _Astra Control Center_ is self-managed software that you install and operate in your data center so that you can manage Kubernetes application lifecycle management for on-premise Kubernetes clusters.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-center[Go to the Astra Control Center documentation to learn more^].

=== Bring your own bucket

You can now manage the buckets that Astra uses for backups and clones by adding additional buckets and by changing the default bucket for the Kubernetes clusters in your cloud provider.

link:../use/manage-buckets.html[Learn more about managing buckets].

== 2 June 2021

This release includes bug fixes and the following enhancements to Google Cloud support.

=== Support for shared VPCs

You can now manage GKE clusters in GCP projects with a shared VPC network configuration.

=== Persistent volume size for the CVS service type

Astra Control Service now creates persistent volumes with a minimum size of 300 GiB when using the CVS service type.

link:../learn/choose-class-and-size.html[Learn how Astra Control Service uses Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud as the storage backend for persistent volumes].

=== Support for Container-Optimized OS

Container-Optimized OS is now supported with GKE worker nodes. This is in addition to support for Ubuntu.

link:../get-started/set-up-google-cloud.html#gke-cluster-requirements[Learn more about GKE cluster requirements].

== 15 Apr 2021

This release includes the following new features and enhancements.

=== Support for AKS clusters

Astra Control Service can now manage apps that are running on a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

link:../get-started/set-up-microsoft-azure-with-anf.html[Learn how to get started].

=== REST API

The Astra Control REST API is now available for use. The API is based on modern technologies and current best practices.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation[Learn how to automate application data lifecycle management using the REST API^].

=== Annual subscription

Astra Control Service now offers a _Premium Subscription_.

Pre-pay at a discounted rate with an annual subscription that enables you to manage up to 10 apps per _application pack_. Contact NetApp Sales to purchase as many packs as needed for your organization--for example, purchase 3 packs to manage 30 apps from Astra Control Service.

If you manage more apps than allowed by your annual subscription, then you'll be charged at the overage rate of $0.005 per minute, per application (the same as Premium PayGo).

link:../get-started/intro.html#pricing[Learn more about Astra Control Service pricing].

=== Namespace and app visualization

We enhanced the Discovered Apps page to better show the hierarchy between namespaces and apps. Just expand a namespace to see the apps contained in that namespace.

link:../use/manage-apps.html[Learn more about managing apps].

=== User interface enhancements

Data protection wizards were enhanced for ease of use. For example, we refined the Protection Policy wizard to more easily view the protection schedule as you define it.

image:screenshot-protection-policy.gif["A screenshot of the Configure Protection Policy dialog box where you can enable Hourly, Daily, Weekly, and Monthly schedules."]

=== Activity enhancements

We've made it easier to view details about the activities in your Astra Control account.

* Filter the activity list by managed app, severity level, user, and time range.
* Download your Astra Control account activity to a CSV file.
* View activities directly from the Clusters page or the Apps page after selecting a cluster or an app.

link:../use/view-account-activity.html[Learn more about viewing your account activity].

== 1 Mar 2021

Astra Control Service now supports the https://cloud.google.com/solutions/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/service-types[_CVS_ service type^] with Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud. This is in addition to already supporting the _CVS-Performance_ service type. Just as a reminder, Astra Control Service uses Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud as the storage backend for your persistent volumes.

This enhancement means that Astra Control Service can now manage app data for Kubernetes clusters that are running in _any_ https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions#cvsGcp[Google Cloud region where Cloud Volumes Service is supported^].

If you have the flexibility to choose between Google Cloud regions, then you can pick either CVS or CVS-Performance, depending on your performance requirements. link:../learn/choose-class-and-size.html[Learn more about choosing a service type].

== 25 Jan 2021

We're pleased to announce that Astra Control Service is now Generally Available. We incorporated a lot of the feedback that we received from the Beta release and made a few other notable enhancements.

* Billing is now available, which enables you to move from the Free Plan to the Premium Plan. link:../use/set-up-billing.html[Learn more about billing].

* Astra Control Service now creates Persistent Volumes with a minimum size of 100 GiB when using the CVS-Performance service type.

* Astra Control Service can now discover apps faster.

* You can now create and delete accounts on your own.

* We've improved notifications when Astra Control Service can no longer access a Kubernetes cluster.
+
These notifications are important because Astra Control Service can't manage apps for disconnected clusters.

== 17 Dec 2020 (Beta update)

We primarily focused on bug fixes to improve your experience, but we made a few other notable enhancements:

* When you add your first Kubernetes compute to Astra Control Service, the object store is now created in the geography where the cluster resides.

* Details about persistent volumes is now available when you view storage details at the compute level.
+
image:screenshot-compute-pvs.gif[A screenshot of the persistent volumes that were provisioned to a Kubernetes cluster.]

* We added an option to restore an application from an existing snapshot or backup.
+
image:screenshot-app-restore.gif[A screenshot of the Data protection tab for an app where you can select the action drop-down to select Restore application.]

* If you delete a Kubernetes cluster that Astra Control Service is managing, the cluster now shows up in a *Removed* state. You can then remove the cluster from Astra Control Service.

* Account owners can now modify the assigned roles for other users.

* We added a section for billing, which will be enabled when Astra Control Service is released for General Availability (GA).
