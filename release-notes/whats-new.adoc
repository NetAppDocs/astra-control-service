NetApp periodically updates Astra to bring you new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

== 15 Apr 2021

This release includes the following new features and enhancements.

=== Support for AKS clusters

Astra can now manage apps that are running on a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

=== REST API

The Astra REST API is now available for use. The API is based on modern technologies and current best practices.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation[Learn how to automate application data lifecycle management using the REST API^].

=== Annual subscription

Astra now offers a _Premium Subscription_.

Pre-pay at a discounted rate with an annual subscription that enables you to manage up to 10 apps per _application pack_. Contact NetApp Sales to purchase as many packs as needed for your organization--for example, purchase 3 packs to manage 30 apps from Astra.

If you manage more apps than allowed by your annual subscription, then you'll be charged at the overage rate of $0.005 per minute, per application (the same as Premium PayGo).

=== Namespace and app visualization

We enhanced the Discovered Apps page to better show the hierarchy between namespaces and apps. Just expand a namespace to see the apps contained in that namespace.

link:../use/manage-apps.html[Learn more about managing apps].

=== User interface enhancements

Data protection wizards were enhanced for ease of use. For example, we refined the Protection Policy wizard to more easily view the protection schedule as you define it.

=== Activity enhancements

We've made it easier to view details about the activities in your Astra account.

* Filter the activity list by managed app, severity level, user, and time range.
* Download your Astra account activity to a CSV file.
* View activities directly from the Compute page or the Apps page after selecting compute or an app.

== 1 Mar 2021

Astra now supports the https://cloud.google.com/solutions/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/service-types[_CVS_ service type^] with Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud. This is in addition to already supporting the _CVS-Performance_ service type. Just as a reminder, Astra uses Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud as the backend storage for your persistent volumes.

This enhancement means that Astra can now manage app data for Kubernetes clusters that are running in _any_ https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions#cvsGcp[Google Cloud region where Cloud Volumes Service is supported^].

If you have the flexibility to choose between Google Cloud regions, then you can pick either CVS or CVS-Performance, depending on your performance requirements. link:../learn/choose-class-and-size.html[Learn more about choosing a service type].

== 25 Jan 2021

We're pleased to announce that Astra is now Generally Available. We incorporated a lot of the feedback that we received from the Beta release and made a few other notable enhancements.

* Billing is now available, which enables you to move from the Free Plan to the Premium Plan. link:../use/set-up-billing.html[Learn more about billing].

* Astra now creates Persistent Volumes with a minimum size of 100 GiB when using the CVS-Performance service type.

* Astra can now discover apps faster.

* You can now create and delete accounts on your own.

* We've improved notifications when Astra can no longer access Kubernetes compute.
+
These notifications are important because Astra can't manage apps for disconnected compute.

== 17 Dec 2020 (Beta update)

We primarily focused on bug fixes to improve your experience, but we made a few other notable enhancements:

* When you add your first Kubernetes compute to Astra, the object store is now created in the geography where the cluster resides.

* Details about persistent volumes is now available when you view storage details at the compute level.
+

* We added an option to restore an application from an existing snapshot or backup.

* If you delete a Kubernetes cluster that Astra is managing, the cluster now shows up in a *Removed* state. You can then remove the cluster from Astra.

* Account owners can now modify the assigned roles for other users.

* We added a section for billing, which will be enabled when Astra is released for General Availability (GA).
