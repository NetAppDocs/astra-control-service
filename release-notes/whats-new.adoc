NetApp periodically updates Astra Control Service to bring you new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

== 13 March 2024

.New features and support

This is a minor bug fix release.

== 7 November 2023

.New features and support

[[nas-eco-backup-restore]]
* *Backup and restore capabilities for applications with ontap-nas-economy driver-backed storage backends*: Enable backup and restore operations for `ontap-nas-economy` with some link:../use/protect-apps.html#enable-backup-and-restore-for-ontap-nas-economy-operations[simple steps^].

* *Astra Control Service support for on-premises Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters*
+
link:../get-started/add-first-cluster.html[Add a cluster^]

* *Immutable Backups*: Astra Control now supports link:../learn/data-protection.html#immutable-backups[unalterable, read-only backups^] as an additional security layer against malware and other threats.

* *Introducing Astra Control Provisioner*
+
With the 23.10 release, Astra Control introduces a new software component called Astra Control Provisioner that will be available to all licensed Astra Control users. Astra Control Provisioner provides access to a superset of advanced management and storage provisioning features beyond those that Astra Trident provides. These features are available to all Astra Control customers at no additional cost.

** *Get started with Astra Control Provisioner*
You can link:../use/enable-acp.html[enable Astra Control Provisioner^] if you have installed and configured your environment to use Astra Trident 23.10.

** *Astra Control Provisioner functionality*
+
The following features are available with the Astra Control Provisioner 23.10 release:

*** *Enhanced storage backend security with Kerberos 5 encryption*: You can improve storage security by link:../use-acp/configure-storage-backend-encryption.html[enabling encryption^] for the traffic between your managed cluster and the storage backend. Astra Control Provisioner supports Kerberos 5 encryption over NFSv4.1 connections from Red Hat OpenShift clusters to Azure NetApp Files and on-premise ONTAP volumes.

*** *Recover data using a snapshot*: Astra Control Provisioner provides rapid, in-place volume restoration from a snapshot using the `TridentActionSnapshotRestore` (TASR) CR.

*** *Backup and restore capabilities for applications with `ontap-nas-economy` driver-backed storage backends*: As described <<nas-eco-backup-restore,above>>.

* *Astra Control Service support for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) clusters*
+
link:../get-started/add-first-cluster.html[Add a cluster^]

* *Support for managing applications that use NVMe/TCP storage*
Astra Control can now manage applications backed by persistent volumes that are connected using NVMe/TCP.

* *Execution hooks turned off by default*: Beginning with this release, execution hooks functionality can be link:../use/manage-app-execution-hooks.html#enable-the-execution-hooks-feature[enabled] or disabled for additional security (it is disabled by default). If you have not yet created execution hooks for use with Astra Control, you need to link:../use/manage-app-execution-hooks.html#enable-the-execution-hooks-feature[enable the execution hooks feature^] to begin creating hooks. If you created execution hooks prior to this release, the execution hooks functionality stays enabled and you can use hooks as you would normally.

ifdef::gcp[]
Astra Control Service now supports the https://cloud.google.com/solutions/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/service-types[_CVS_ service type^] with Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud. This is in addition to already supporting the _CVS-Performance_ service type. Just as a reminder, Astra Control Service uses Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud as the storage backend for your persistent volumes.

This enhancement means that Astra Control Service can now manage app data for Kubernetes clusters that are running in _any_ https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions#cvsGcp[Google Cloud region where Cloud Volumes Service is supported^].

If you have the flexibility to choose between Google Cloud regions, then you can pick either CVS or CVS-Performance, depending on your performance requirements. link:../learn/choose-class-and-size.html[Learn more about choosing a service type^].
endif::gcp[]

== 25 January 2021

We're pleased to announce that Astra Control Service is now Generally Available. We incorporated a lot of the feedback that we received from the Beta release and made a few other notable enhancements.

* Billing is now available, which enables you to move from the Free Plan to the Premium Plan. link:../use/set-up-billing.html[Learn more about billing^].

* Astra Control Service now creates Persistent Volumes with a minimum size of 100 GiB when using the CVS-Performance service type.

* Astra Control Service can now discover apps faster.

* You can now create and delete accounts on your own.

* We've improved notifications when Astra Control Service can no longer access a Kubernetes cluster.
+
These notifications are important because Astra Control Service can't manage apps for disconnected clusters.

== 17 December 2020 (Beta update)

We primarily focused on bug fixes to improve your experience, but we made a few other notable enhancements:

* When you add your first Kubernetes compute to Astra Control Service, the object store is now created in the geography where the cluster resides.

* Details about persistent volumes is now available when you view storage details at the compute level.
+
image:screenshot-compute-pvs.gif[A screenshot of the persistent volumes that were provisioned to a Kubernetes cluster.]

* We added an option to restore an application from an existing snapshot or backup.
+
image:screenshot-app-restore.gif[A screenshot of the Data protection tab for an app where you can select the action drop-down to select Restore application.]

* If you delete a Kubernetes cluster that Astra Control Service is managing, the cluster now shows up in a *Removed* state. You can then remove the cluster from Astra Control Service.

* Account owners can now modify the assigned roles for other users.

* We added a section for billing, which will be enabled when Astra Control Service is released for General Availability (GA).
