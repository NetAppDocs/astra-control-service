Known issues identify problems that might prevent you from using this release of the product successfully.

== Backup taken from new snapshot instead of existing snapshot

When you create a backup and select *Backup from existing snapshot*, Astra Control creates an ad-hoc snapshot and uses that snapshot to create the backup. Astra Control doesn't use the existing snapshot.

== Clone performance impacted by large persistent volumes

Clones of very large and consumed persistent volumes might be intermittently slow, dependent on cluster access to the object store. If the clone is hung and no data has been copied for more than 30 minutes, Astra Control terminates the clone action.
