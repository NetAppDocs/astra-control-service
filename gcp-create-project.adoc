To use Project Astra you will need to have a GCP project created with the correct APIs enabled. If you don't already have a GCP project, follow these steps to create a new one.

== Create a Project

Log in to the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Console]. Click *Select a Project* on the top left navigation bar.
