Learn how to create, manage, and restore from snapshots.

== Create a Snapshot

Project Astra takes application-consistent snapshots for all the volumes under use by this application. Learn how to create a snapshot of your application. This creates a recovery point for your app, in case of a failure.

NOTE: When you create a snapshot, you will not lose connection to the database. However, creating a snapshot may cause a temporary slowdown to your operations.

Click **Apps**, then click on the name of your app to select that cluster.

Click the **Available** menu on the right. Select **Snapshot** from the drop-down menu.

Fill out the details for your snapshot in the pop-up window. These will default to a system-generated name for the snapshot, and the current name of your app and cluster. Click **Review & Approve** to continue to the second step.

Click **Snapshot App** to create the snapshot.

After the snapshot has finished being built, you can view it on the **Data Protection** tab for your cluster.

NOTE: Snapshots are available on the Data Protection tab for the relevant cluster. During the alpha preview program, new snapshots will not be available immediately on the Storage tab. They will appear on the Storage tab within 24 hours.

== View Snapshots

Learn how to find the snapshots for your app, arranged by timestamp. Snapshots can be seen on the Data Protection tab for the relevant application as soon as they are created.

Click **Apps**, then click on the name of your app.
