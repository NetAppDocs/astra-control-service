In order to participate in the Project Astra alpha program, you will need to set up NetApp Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud.

Before you begin using NetApp CVS, you will need to verify that your role is set up correctly, and complete a few one-time set-up tasks per project. https://cloud.google.com/solutions/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/before-you-begin-cloud-volumes[See the CVS start-up guide for details and step-by-step instructions.]
