= Add a public self-managed cluster to Astra Control Service
:hardbreaks:
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/get-started/

[.lead]
After you set up your environment, you're ready to create a Kubernetes cluster and then add it to Astra Control Service.

A self-managed cluster is a cluster that you directly provision and manage. Astra Control Service supports self-managed clusters that run in a public cloud environment. You can add a self-managed cluster to Astra Control Service by uploading a `kubeconfig.yaml` file. You'll need to ensure the cluster meets the requirements outlined here.

== Supported Kubernetes distributions

You can use Astra Control Service to manage the following types of public, self-managed clusters:

[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
|Kubernetes distribution |Supported versions

// |Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI
// |Azure Stack HCI 21H2 and 22H2 with AKS 1.23 and 1.24

// |Google Anthos
// |1.12 through 1.14

|Kubernetes (Upstream)
|1.26 to 1.28 

|Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE)
|RKE 1.3 with Rancher 2.6
RKE 1.4 with Rancher 2.7
RKE 2 (v1.23.x) with Rancher 2.6
RKE 2 (v1.24.x) with Rancher 2.7

|Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
|4.12 through 4.14

// |VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid
// |1.6

// |VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition
// |1.14 and 1.15
|===

These instructions assume that you have already created a self-managed cluster.

== Add the cluster to Astra Control Service

After you log in to Astra Control Service, your first step is to start managing your clusters. Before you add a cluster to Astra Control Service, you'll need to perform specific tasks and make sure the cluster meets certain requirements.

.Before you begin
[%collapsible%open]
=======
A self-managed cluster is a cluster that you directly provision and manage. Astra Control Service supports self-managed clusters that run in a public cloud environment. Your self-managed clusters can use Astra Trident to interface with NetApp storage services, or they can use Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers to interface with Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), Azure Managed Disks, and Google Persistent Disk. 

Astra Control Service supports self-managed clusters that use the following Kubernetes distributions:

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
* Rancher Kubernetes Engine
* Upstream Kubernetes 

Your self-managed cluster needs to meet the following requirements:

* The cluster must be accessible via the internet.
//* The cluster cannot be hosted within your on-premises network; it must be hosted in a public cloud environment.
* If you are using or plan to use storage enabled with CSI drivers, the appropriate CSI drivers must be installed on the cluster. For more information on using CSI drivers to integrate storage, refer to the documentation for your storage service.
* You have access to the cluster kubeconfig file that includes only one context element. Follow link:create-kubeconfig.html[these instructions^] to generate a kubeconfig file.
* If you are adding the cluster using a kubeconfig file that references a private Certificate Authority (CA), add the following line to the `cluster` section of the kubeconfig file. This enables Astra Control to add the cluster:
+
----
insecure-skip-tls-verify: true
----
* *Rancher only*: When managing application clusters in a Rancher environment, modify the application cluster's default context in the kubeconfig file provided by Rancher to use a control plane context instead of the Rancher API server context. This reduces load on the Rancher API server and improves performance.
*	*Astra Trident*: If you are using or plan to use NetApp storage, ensure that you have installed the latest version of Astra Trident. If Astra Trident is already installed, link:check-astra-trident-version.html[check to make sure it is the latest version^].
+
NOTE: You can https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy.html#choose-the-deployment-method[deploy Astra Trident^] using either Trident operator (manually or using Helm chart) or `tridentctl`. Prior to installing or upgrading Astra Trident, review the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/requirements.html[supported frontends, backends, and host configurations^].

** *Astra Trident storage backend configured*: At least one Astra Trident storage backend must be https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/backends.html[configured^] on the cluster.
** *Astra Trident storage classes configured*: At least one Astra Trident storage class must be https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/manage-stor-class.html[configured^] on the cluster. If a default storage class is configured, ensure that only one storage class has that annotation.
** *Astra Trident volume snapshot controller and volume snapshot class installed and configured*: The volume snapshot controller must be https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/vol-snapshots.html#deploying-a-volume-snapshot-controller[installed^] so that snapshots can be created in Astra Control. At least one Astra Trident `VolumeSnapshotClass` has been https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/vol-snapshots.html#step-1-set-up-a-volumesnapshotclass[set up^] by an administrator.
// Removed ONTAP credentials commands from ACC as Vijitha said they are not needed - ASTRADOC-21
=======

* *Astra Control Provisioner*: To use Astra Control Provisioner advanced management and storage provisioning features that are only accessible to Astra Control users, you must install Astra Trident 23.10 or later and enable link:../use/enable-acp.html[Astra Control Provisioner functionality].

.Steps

. On the Dashboard, select *Manage Kubernetes cluster*.
+
Follow the prompts to add the cluster.

. *Provider*: Select the *Other* tab to add details about your self-managed cluster.

.. *Other*: Provide details about your self-managed cluster by uploading a `kubeconfig.yaml` file or by pasting the contents of the `kubeconfig.yaml` file from your clipboard.
+
NOTE: If you create your own `kubeconfig` file, you should define only *one* context element in it. Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/[Kubernetes documentation^] for information about creating `kubeconfig` files.

. *Credential name*: Provide a name for the self-managed cluster credential you are uploading to Astra Control. By default, the credential name is auto-populated as the name of the cluster.

. *Private route identifier*: This field is for use with private clusters only.

. Select *Next*.

. (Optional) *Storage*: Optionally, select the storage class that you'd like Kubernetes applications deployed to this cluster to use by default.
.. To select a new default storage class for the cluster, enable the *Assign a new default storage class* check box.
.. Select a new default storage class from the list.

. Select *Next*.
. *Review & Approve*: Review the configuration details.
. Select *Add* to add the cluster to Astra Control Service.

== Change the default storage class
You can change the default storage class for a cluster.

=== Change the default storage class using Astra Control
You can change the default storage class for a cluster from within Astra Control. If your cluster uses a previously installed storage backend service, you might not be able to use this method to change the default storage class (the *Set as default* action is not selectable). In this case, you can <<Change the default storage class using the command line>>.

.Steps

. In the Astra Control Service UI, select *Clusters*.
. On the *Clusters* page, select the cluster that you want to change.
. Select the *Storage* tab.
. Select the *Storage classes* category.
. Select the *Actions* menu for the storage class that you want to set as default.
. Select *Set as default*.

=== Change the default storage class using the command line
You can change the default storage class for a cluster using Kubernetes commands. This method works regardless of your cluster's configuration.

.Steps

. Log in to your Kubernetes cluster. 
. List the storage classes in your cluster:
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl get storageclass
----
. Remove the default designation from the default storage class. Replace <SC_NAME> with the name of the storage class: 
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl patch storageclass <SC_NAME> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"false"}}}'
----
. Mark a different storage class as default. Replace <SC_NAME> with the name of the storage class:
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl patch storageclass <SC_NAME> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
----
. Confirm the new default storage class:
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl get storageclass
----
