A few steps are required to prepare your Google Cloud project before you can manage Google Kubernetes Engine clusters with Project Astra.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Set up a Google Cloud account and project

You need a https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial[Google Cloud account^] and https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects[a project^].

The following image depicts the steps that you'll need to complete.

== Create a service account that has the required permissions

Project Astra uses a Google Cloud service account to facilitate Kubernetes application data management on your behalf.

.Steps

. Go to Google Cloud and https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating_a_service_account[create a service account by using the console, gcloud command, or another preferred method^].

. Grant the service account the following roles:
+
* *Kubernetes Engine Admin* - Used to list clusters and create admin access to manage apps.

* *Cloud Volumes Admin* - Used to manage persistent storage for apps.

* *Cloud Storage Admin* - Used to manage buckets and objects for backups of apps.

* *Service Usage Viewer* - Used to check if the required Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud APIs are enabled.

* *Compute Network Viewer* - Used to check if the Kubernetes VPC is allowed to reach Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud.

The following video shows how to create the service account from the Google Cloud console.

== Create a service account key

Instead of providing a user name and password to Project Astra, you'll provide a service account key when you add your first cluster. Project Astra uses the service account key to establish the identity of the service account that you just set up.

The service account key is plaintext stored in the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. It contains information about the GCP resources that you have permission to access.

You can only view or download the JSON file when you create the key. However, you can create a new key at any time.

.Steps

. Go to Google Cloud and https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating_service_account_keys[create a service account key by using the console, gcloud command, or another preferred method^].

. When prompted, save the service account key file in a secure location.

The following video shows how to create the service account key from the Google Cloud console.

video::video-create-gcp-service-account-key.mp4[width=848, height=480]

== Enable APIs in your Google Cloud project

Your project needs permissions to access specific Google Cloud APIs. APIs are used to interact with Google Cloud resources, such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters and NetApp Cloud Volumes Service storage.

.Step

. https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/enable-api[Use the Google Cloud console or gcloud CLI to enable the following APIs^]:
+
* Google Kubernetes Engine
* Cloud Storage
* Cloud Storage JSON API
* Service Usage
* Cloud Resource Manager API
* NetApp Cloud Volumes Service
* Service Networking API
* Service Management API
+
The last two APIs are required for Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud.

The following video shows how to enable the APIs from the Google Cloud console.

video::video-enable-gcp-apis.mp4[width=848, height=480]

== Enable private service access to Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud

Project Astra uses Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud as the backend storage for your persistent volumes. Other than the APIs that you enabled in the previous step, the only other requirement is to enable private service access to Cloud Volumes Service.

.Step

. Set up private service access from your project to create a high-throughput and low-latency data-path connection, https://cloud.google.com/solutions/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/setting-up-private-services-access[as described in the Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud documentation^].
