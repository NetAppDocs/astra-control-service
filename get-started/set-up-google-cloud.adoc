== GKE cluster requirements

A Kubernetes cluster must meet the following requirements so you can discover and manage it from Astra.

Kubernetes version:: A cluster must be running Kubernetes version 1.17 or later.

Image type:: The image type for each worker node must be Ubuntu.

Cluster state:: Clusters must be running in a healthy state and have at least one online worker node with no worker nodes in a failed state.

Google Cloud region:: Clusters must be running in a https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions#cvsGc[Google Cloud region where Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud is supported.] Note that Astra supports both service types: CVS and CVS-Performance.

Networking:: The cluster must reside in a VPC that is peered with Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud. <<Set up network peering for your VPC,This step is described below>>.

Private clusters:: If the cluster is private, it must have the https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/private-cluster-concept[master authorized network^] set to allow the Astra IP addresses:
*	54.164.233.140/32
*	3.218.120.204/32
*	34.193.99.138/32

Mode of operation for a GKE cluster:: You should use the Standard mode of operation. The Autopilot mode hasn't been tested at this time. link:https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/types-of-clusters#modes[Learn more about modes of operation].

== Purchase Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud

Astra uses Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud as the backend storage for your persistent volumes. You need to purchase Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud from the Google Cloud Marketplace to enable billing for persistent volumes.

.Step

. Go to the https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/endpoints/cloudvolumesgcp-api.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Volumes Service page^] in the Google Cloud Marketplace, click *Purchase*, and follow the prompts.
+
https://cloud.google.com/solutions/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/quickstart#purchase_the_service[Follow step-by-step instructions in the Google Cloud documentation to purchase and enable the service^].

== Enable APIs in your project

Your project needs permissions to access specific Google Cloud APIs. APIs are used to interact with Google Cloud resources, such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters and NetApp Cloud Volumes Service storage.

.Step

. https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/enable-api[Use the Google Cloud console or gcloud CLI to enable the following APIs^]:
+
* Google Kubernetes Engine
* Cloud Storage
* Cloud Storage JSON API
* Service Usage
* Cloud Resource Manager API
* NetApp Cloud Volumes Service
* Service Consumer Management API
* Service Networking API
* Service Management API

The following video shows how to enable the APIs from the Google Cloud console.

== Create a service account and key

Astra uses a Google Cloud service account to facilitate Kubernetes application data management on your behalf.

Instead of providing a user name and password to Astra, you'll provide a service account key when you add your first cluster. Astra uses the service account key to establish the identity of the service account that you just set up.

The service account key is plaintext stored in the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. It contains information about the GCP resources that you have permission to access.

You can only view or download the JSON file when you create the key. However, you can create a new key at any time.

.Steps

. Go to Google Cloud and https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating_a_service_account[create a service account by using the console, gcloud command, or another preferred method^].

. Grant the service account the following roles:
+
* *Kubernetes Engine Admin* - Used to list clusters and create admin access to manage apps.

* *NetApp Cloud Volumes Admin* - Used to manage persistent storage for apps.

* *Storage Admin* - Used to manage buckets and objects for backups of apps.

* *Service Usage Viewer* - Used to check if the required Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud APIs are enabled.

* *Compute Network Viewer* - Used to check if the Kubernetes VPC is allowed to reach Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud.
+
If you'd like to use gcloud, you can follow steps from within the Astra user interface. Click *Account > Credentials > Add Credentials*, and then click *Instructions*.
+
If you'd like to use the Google Cloud console, the following video shows how to create the service account from the console.
+

. Now https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating_service_account_keys[create a service account key by using the console, gcloud command, or another preferred method^].

. When prompted, save the service account key file in a secure location.

== Set up network peering for your VPC

The final step is to set up networking peering from your VPC to Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud.

The easiest way to set up network peering is by obtaining the gcloud commands directly from Cloud Volumes Service. The commands are available from Cloud Volumes Service when creating a new file system.

.Steps

. https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions#cvsGcp[Go to NetApp Cloud Central's Global Regions Maps^] and identify the service type that you'll be using in the Google Cloud region where your cluster resides.
+
Cloud Volumes Service provides two service types: CVS and CVS-Performance. https://cloud.google.com/solutions/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/service-types[Learn more about these service types^].

. https://console.cloud.google.com/netapp/cloud-volumes/volumes[Go to Cloud Volumes in Google Cloud Platform^].

. On the *Volumes* page, click *Create*.

. Under *Service Type*, select either *CVS* or *CVS-Performance*.
+
You need to choose the correct service type for your Google Cloud region. This is the service type that you identified in step 1. After you select a service type, the list of regions on the page updates with the regions where that service type is supported.
+
After this step, you'll only need to enter your networking information to obtain the commands.

. Under *Region*, select your region and zone.

. Under *Network Details*, select your VPC.
+
If you haven't set up network peering, you'll see the following notification:
+
image:gcp-peering.gif[]

. Click the button to view the network peering set up commands.

. Copy the commands and run them in Cloud Shell.
+
For more details about using these commands, refer to the https://cloud.google.com/solutions/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/quickstart#configure_private_services_access_and_set_up_network_peering[Quickstart for Cloud Volumes Service for GCP^].
+
https://cloud.google.com/solutions/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/setting-up-private-services-access[Learn more about configuring private services access and setting up network peering^].

. After you're done, you can click cancel on the *Create File System* page.
+
We started creating this volume only to get the commands for network peering.
