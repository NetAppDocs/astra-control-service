You can use Astra Control Service to manage private Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters as well as private Red Hat OpenShift clusters in AKS. These instructions assume that you have already created a private AKS or OpenShift cluster and prepared a secure method to remotely access it; for more information about creating and accessing private AKS clusters, refer to the https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/private-clusters[Azure documentation^].

You can use Astra Control Service to manage private Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters. These instructions assume that you have already created a private EKS cluster and prepared a secure method to remotely access it; for more information about creating and accessing private EKS clusters, refer to the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/private-clusters.html[Amazon EKS documentation^].

== Install the Astra Connector operator
You need to install the Astra Connector operator on the private cluster. If you are using a bastion host, issue these commands from the command line of the bastion host. 

.Steps

. Clone the Astra Connector operator GitHub repository:
+
[source,console]
----
git clone https://github.com/NetApp/astra-connector-operator.git
----
. Change directories to the top level of the unpacked operator package, so that you can see the `astraconnector_operator.yaml` file with the `ls` command.

. Create a namespace for the Astra Connector operator.
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl create ns astra-connector-operator
----

. Apply the `astraconnector_operator.yaml` file to the operator namespace.
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl apply -f astraconnector_operator.yaml -n astra-connector-operator
----

. Create a namespace for the private cluster components.
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl create ns astra-connector
----

. Generate an Astra Control API token using the instructions in the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/get-started/get_api_token.html[Astra Automation documentation^].

. Modify the example configuration file in the config/samples directory of the Astra Connector operator repository to fit your needs.

. Apply the Astra Connector Custom Resource Definition (CRD).
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl apply -f config/samples/astraconnector_v1.yaml -n astra-connector
----

. Check the status of the Astra Connector.
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl get astraconnector astra-connector -n astra-connector
----
+
You should refer to output similar to the following:
+
[source,console]
----
NAME              REGISTERED   ASTRACONNECTORID
astra-connector   true         22b839aa-8b85-445a-85dd-0b1f53b5ea19
----

== Set up persistent storage
Configure persistent storage for the cluster. You can use Azure NetApp Files or Azure managed disks. Refer to the Get Started documentation for more information about configuring Azure with these options:

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-service/get-started/set-up-microsoft-azure-with-anf.html[Set up Microsoft Azure with Azure NetApp Files]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-service/get-started/set-up-microsoft-azure-with-amd.html[Set up Microsoft Azure with Azure managed disks]

== Add the private cluster to Astra Control Service
You can now add the private cluster to Astra Control Service. Follow the standard workflow to add a cluster to Astra Control Service: https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-service/get-started/add-first-cluster.html[Start managing Kubernetes clusters from Astra Control Service].
