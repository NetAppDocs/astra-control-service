A few steps are required to prepare your Amazon Web Services project before you can manage Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters with Astra Control Service.

== Quick start for setting up Amazon Web Services

Get started quickly by following these steps or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Ensure that clusters are healthy and running a supported version of Kubernetes, that worker nodes are online and running Linux or Windows, and more. <<EKS cluster requirements,Learn more about this step>>.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you don't already have an Amazon account, you need to create one so that you can use EKS. <<Create an Amazon account,Learn more about this step>>.

== EKS cluster requirements

A Kubernetes cluster must meet the following requirements so you can discover and manage it from Astra Control Service.

Kubernetes version:: A cluster must be running a Kubernetes version in the range of 1.20 to 1.22.

Image type:: The image type for each worker node must be one of the following:
* Linux
* Windows (self-managed)

Cluster state:: Clusters must be running in a healthy state and have at least one online worker node with no worker nodes in a failed state.

//Networking:: question

//Private clusters:: question

External volume snapshot controller:: Clusters must have a CSI volume snapshot controller installed. This controller is installed by default starting with K8s version 1.21, but you'll need to check on clusters running versions 1.19 and 1.20. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/vol-snapshots.html[Learn more about an external snapshot controller for on-demand volume snapshots^].

CSI drivers:: Clusters must have the appropriate CSI drivers installed.

== Create an Amazon account

If you don't already have an Amazon account, you need to create one to enable billing for Amazon EKS.

.Steps

. Go to the https://www.amazon.com[Amazon homepage^] , select *Sign in* at the top right, and select *Start here*.
. Follow the prompts to create an account.

== Install the Amazon Web Services CLI

Install the AWS CLI so that you can manage AWS resources from the command line.

.Step

. Go to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html[Getting started with the AWS CLI^] and follow the instructions to install the CLI.

== Create an IAM user
Create an IAM user so that you can use and manage AWS services and resources with increased security.

.Step

. Go to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_cliwpsapi[Creating IAM users^] and follow the instructions to create an IAM user.

== Create and attach a permissions policy
Create a policy with the required permissions for Astra Control Service to interact with your AWS account.

.Steps

. Create a new file called `policy.json`.
. Copy the following JSON content into the file:
+
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudwatch:GetMetricData",
                "fsx:DescribeVolumes",
                "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                "s3:CreateBucket",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy",
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                "eks:DescribeCluster",
                "eks:ListNodegroups",
                "eks:DescribeNodegroup",
                "eks:ListClusters",
                "iam:GetUser",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:DeleteBucket",
                "autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
----
. Create the policy:
+
----
POLICY_ARN=$(aws iam create-policy  --policy-name <policy-name> --policy-document file://policy.json  --query='Policy.Arn' --output=text)
----
. Attach the policy to the IAM user. Replace `<IAM-USER-NAME>` with the user name of the IAM user you created:
+
----
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <IAM-USER-NAME> --policy-arn=$POLICY_ARN
----

== Save the credentials for the IAM user
Save the credentials for the IAM user so that you can make Astra Control Service aware of the new user. Make sure that the account whose credentials you save is the same account used to create the cluster.

.Steps

. Download the credentials. Replace `<IAM-USER-NAME>` with the user name of the IAM user you created:
+
----
aws iam create-access-key --user-name <IAM-USER-NAME> > credential.json
----

.Result
The `credential.json` file is created, and you can import the credentials in to Astra Control Service.
