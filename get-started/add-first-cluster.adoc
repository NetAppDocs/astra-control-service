After you set up your environment, you're ready to create a Kubernetes cluster and then add it to Astra.

== Create a Kubernetes cluster

If you don't have a cluster yet, create a cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) link:requirements.html[that meets Astra requirements].

== Start managing Kubernetes compute

After you log in to Astra, your first step is to start managing compute.

.Steps

. On the Dashboard, click *Manage Kubernetes compute*.
+
Follow the prompts to add the compute.

. *Provider*: Provide the service account key file either by uploading the file or by pasting the contents from your clipboard.
+

+
Astra uses the service account to discover compute running in Google Kubernetes Engine.

. *Compute*: Select the compute that you'd like to add.
+
Pay careful attention to the Eligible tab. If a warning appears, hover over the warning to determine if there's an issue with the compute. For example, it might identify that the cluster doesn't have a worker node.

. *Storage*: Select the default storage class that you'd like to use with this compute.
+
Each storage class utilizes https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-service-for-gcp[Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud^].
+

. *Review & Approve*: Review the configuration details and click *Add compute*.

The following video shows each of these steps.

.Result

Astra creates an object store for application backups, creates an admin account on the cluster, and sets the default storage class that you specified. This process can take up to 5 minutes.
