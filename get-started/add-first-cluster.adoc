After you set up your environment, you're ready to create a Kubernetes cluster and then add it to Astra.

== Create a Kubernetes cluster

If you don't have a cluster yet, create a cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) link:requirements.html[that meets Astra requirements].

== Add the cluster to Astra

After you log in to Astra, your first step is to add a Kubernetes cluster.

.Steps

. On the Dashboard, click *Add a Kubernetes compute*.
+
Follow the prompts to add the cluster.

. *Provider*: Provide the service account key file either by uploading the file or by pasting the contents from your clipboard.

+
Astra uses the service account to discover the clusters running in Google Kubernetes Engine.

. *Compute*: Select the cluster that you'd like to add and click *Configure storage*.
+
Pay careful attention to the Eligible tab. If a warning appears, hover over the warning to determine if there's an issue with the cluster. For example, it might identify the cluster doesn't have a worker node.

. *Storage*: Select the default storage class that you'd like to use with this cluster and click *Review information*.
+
Each storage class utilizes https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-service-for-gcp[Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud^].

. *Review & Approve*: Review the configuration details and click *Add compute*.

The following video shows how to add a cluster.

.Result

Astra creates an object store for application backups, creates an admin account on the cluster, and sets the default storage class that you specified. This process takes up to 5 minutes.
