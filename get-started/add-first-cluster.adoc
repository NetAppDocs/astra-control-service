After you set up your environment, you're ready to create a Kubernetes cluster and then add it to Astra Control Service.

== Create a Kubernetes cluster

If you don't have a cluster yet, create one that meets link:set-up-microsoft-azure.html#aks-cluster-requirements[Astra Control Service requirements for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)].

== Start managing Kubernetes compute

After you log in to Astra Control Service, your first step is to start managing compute.

.What you'll need

or AKS, you should have the JSON file that contains the output from the Azure CLI when you created the service principal. link:../get-started/set-up-microsoft-azure.html#create-an-azure-service-principal-2[Learn how to set up a service principal].

You'll also need your Azure subscription ID, if you didn't add it to the JSON file.

.Steps

. On the Dashboard, click *Manage Kubernetes compute*.
+
Follow the prompts to add the compute.

. *Provider*: Select your cloud provider and then provide the required credentials.

.. *Microsoft Azure*: Provide details about your Azure service principal by uploading a JSON file or by pasting the contents of that JSON file from your clipboard.
+
The JSON file should contain the output from the Azure CLI when you created the service principal. It can also include your subscription ID so it's automatically added to Astra. Otherwise, you need to manually enter the ID after providing the JSON.

. *Compute*: Select the compute that you'd like to add.
+
Pay careful attention to the Eligible tab. If a warning appears, hover over the warning to determine if there's an issue with the compute. For example, it might identify that the cluster doesn't have a worker node.

. *Storage*: Select the storage class that you'd like Kubernetes applications deployed to this compute to use by default.
+
Each storage class utilizes https://cloud.netapp.com/azure-netapp-files[Azure NetApp Files^].
+

. *Review & Approve*: Review the configuration details and click *Add compute*.
+

.Result

Astra Control Service creates an object store for application backups, creates an admin account on the cluster, and sets the default storage class that you specified. This process can take up to 5 minutes.
