NetApp periodically updates Astra to bring you new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

== 17 Dec 2020

We primarily focused on bug fixes to improve your experience, but we made a few other notable enhancements:

* When you add your first Kubernetes cluster to Astra, the object store is now created in the geography where the cluster resides.

* Details about persistent volumes is now available at the Compute level.

* We added an option to restore an application from an existing snapshot or backup.

* If you delete a Kubernetes cluster that Astra is managing, the cluster now shows up in a *Removed* state. You can then remove the cluster from Astra.
